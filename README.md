# Indigitous Hack Survival Guide

Welcome to Indigitous Hack! If you're one of our missionary-hackers looking for resources, this is the place for you! We have collected a number of blog posts, resources, data sets, tutorials, and more in order to help you get your project running in no time.

In addition to the `#hack` channel on our Slack, your fellow hackers at your site, and the mentors around, you can use this repo to find information you need on things such as which editors to use, how to set up a particular server type, using AWS or Digital Ocean, and even resources on Natural Language Processing.
