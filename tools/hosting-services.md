## Hosting services

Hosting services and tools of various flavors

### Compute services

  - [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    - Dead simple, cheap, reliable server hosting with APIs. Get a new server in 55 seconds.
  - [AWS Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com/)
    - AWS instances starting at $5 a month
  - [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.gcom)
  - [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - [Cloud9](https://c9.io)
    - Your IDE in the cloud. Pair programming the cloud. Free compute resources. All in the cloud. This is amazing.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - Google's mobile backend as a service
  - [Now](https://zeit.co/now)
    - Simplified Node hosting

### Serverless

  - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    - Need to run code as a responce to an event or build a REST API? Complex, powerful and steep learning curve
    
### Content delivery networks

Edge Caching, Content Optimizations, DDoS prevention and traffic filtering. 

  - [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
  - [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
  - [Google Project Shield](https://projectshield.withgoogle.com/public/)
  - [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) (varnish as a service)

### Misc., potentially terrible ideas (do not use this in production)

   - [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
     - "Secure", free tunnel to localhost (this makes Briggs cry)
