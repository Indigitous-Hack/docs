### API testing and building

  - [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/)
    - *THE* tool for testing APIs
  - [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
    - Don't rebuild the wheel unless you need to. Zapier interfaces with LOTS of APIs so you don't have to.
  - [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)
    - Very similar to Zapier. 
    

### CORS Tools

Using these tools allow you to make cross origin requests by bypassing CORS headers. This is bad for security and can let hackers steal your data more easily. For more information on CORS check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

**Use these tools at your own risk.**
